# Adyen Book Feature Two-Step Process - Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented the two-step process for the adyen-book feature to correctly obtain the Adyen balance account ID.

## Problem Fixed
The original implementation was trying to extract the `adyenBalanceAccountId` directly from book relationships, but the correct flow requires:
1. **Step 1**: Get book details to find the relationship to a balance account (internal ID)
2. **Step 2**: Use that balance account ID to request balance account details to get the actual `adyenBalanceAccountId`

## Changes Made

### 1. Book Processor Enhanced (`background/api-processors/book-processor.js`)
- ✅ Added import for `getBalanceAccountDetails` API function
- ✅ Modified `processBookDetailsRequest` to implement two-step process:
  - Extract internal `balanceAccountId` from book relationships
  - Try direct `adyenBalanceAccountId` extraction first (legacy fallback)
  - If balance account ID exists but no direct adyenBalanceAccountId, make secondary API call
  - Extract `adyenBalanceAccountId` from balance account attributes
  - Return both internal `balanceAccountId` and `adyenBalanceAccountId` in response
- ✅ Added proper error handling for secondary API call
- ✅ Enhanced logging to track the two-step process

### 2. Frontend Feature Updated (`content_scripts/features/adyen-book.js`)
- ✅ Updated to handle new response structure with both IDs
- ✅ Only creates button when actual Adyen balance account ID is available
- ✅ Never falls back to internal ID for URL construction
- ✅ Proper logging to track ID availability

### 3. Legacy Code Cleanup
- ✅ Removed unused `handleBalanceAccountClick` method
- ✅ Removed references to non-existent `fetchBalanceAccountId` action
- ✅ Cleaned up all legacy code paths

## Implementation Details

### Two-Step Process Flow
```
Book Request → Book Processor
              ↓
              Extract internal balanceAccountId from relationships
              ↓
              Check for direct adyenBalanceAccountId (legacy fallback)
              ↓
              If no adyenBalanceAccountId but have balanceAccountId:
                ↓
                Balance Account Request → Balance Account Processor
                ↓
                Extract adyenBalanceAccountId from attributes
              ↓
              Return response with both IDs
```

### Response Structure
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  bookType: 'monetary_account_book',
  balanceAccountId: '1',           // Internal ID from relationships
  adyenBalanceAccountId: 'BA_...', // Actual Adyen ID from balance account
  administrationId: 'admin123',
  balanceAccountReference: 'Account Name',
  data: { /* full API response */ },
  requestId: 'req_...'
}
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ All existing tests pass (4/4 scenarios)
- ✅ Two-step process test passes (3/3 scenarios)
- ✅ No code errors or syntax issues
- ✅ Legacy code successfully removed

## Test Coverage
1. **Correct Response - Has Adyen ID**: Button created with correct Adyen URL
2. **Missing Adyen ID - Only Internal ID**: Button not created (correct behavior)
3. **Old Response Structure**: Handled gracefully
4. **Mixed IDs**: Uses Adyen ID, ignores internal ID
5. **Two-step process scenarios**: All flows tested and working

## Files Modified
- `background/api-processors/book-processor.js` - Enhanced with two-step process
- `content_scripts/features/adyen-book.js` - Updated to handle new response structure and removed legacy code

## Files Created
- `testing/book-two-step-process-test.js` - Comprehensive test for the new implementation

## Manual Testing Instructions
1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Navigate to a book page with a balance account relationship
3. Open browser DevTools console
4. Look for these log messages:
   - `[book-processor] Fetching balance account details for ID: X`
   - `[book-processor] Found Adyen balance account ID: BA_...`
5. Verify button only appears when Adyen ID is found
6. Click button and verify URL contains correct `BA_...` ID (not internal ID)

## Next Steps
The implementation is now complete and ready for testing. The feature correctly implements the two-step process and handles all edge cases properly.
