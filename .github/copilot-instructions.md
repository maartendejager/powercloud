Create and maintain documentation for your code. This will help you and others understand the code in the future. See ARCHITECTURE.md and README.md.
- README.md contains an overview of the extension and the project structure if you need to know where you will be likely to find files or where you should save files
- ARCHITECTURE.md contains the architectural principles which we try to stick to for this extension
- manifest.json is the entryway for any chrome extension
Try to keep .js files small and focused on a single task - no more than 350 lines of code. If a file is getting too large, consider splitting it into multiple files.
Identify the main components of the code and understand how they interact with each other.
Use CSS for styling and layout. Avoid using inline styles for layout.
After resolving any issues, stop so that I can test the results. I will then ask you to continue with the next steps.
If you are following a plan, stop after earch step so I can review the results and ask you to continue with the next steps.
