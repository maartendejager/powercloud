# Background Directory

This directory contains the background service worker and supporting modules for the PowerCloud extension.

## Structure

- `service-worker.js` - Main entry point for the extension's background processing
- `token-manager.js` - Manages authentication tokens for API requests
- `api-processors/` - Contains processors for API requests and responses
- `message-handlers/` - Contains handlers for messages received by the service worker

## Service Worker

The service worker (`service-worker.js`) is the main background script for the extension. It:

1. Sets up web request listeners for capturing API tokens
2. Initializes token storage when the extension is installed
3. Handles messages from the popup and content scripts

## Token Manager

The token manager (`token-manager.js`) is responsible for:

1. Storing, retrieving, and updating authentication tokens
2. Setting up web request listeners to capture tokens
3. Validating tokens and filtering invalid or expired ones

## API Processors

The API processors directory contains modules for making API requests and processing responses. Each processor:

1. Makes requests to specific API endpoints
2. Extracts relevant data from responses
3. Transforms the data into a format usable by the extension
4. Handles errors and edge cases consistently

## Message Handlers

The message handlers directory contains modules for handling messages from the popup and content scripts. Each handler:

1. Validates message parameters
2. Calls the appropriate API processor or token manager function
3. Sends a response back to the caller

## Guidelines

- Keep modules small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `index.js` files to re-export functions for cleaner imports
- Document all functions with JSDoc comments
- Handle errors consistently and provide meaningful error messages
- Log important information for debugging
