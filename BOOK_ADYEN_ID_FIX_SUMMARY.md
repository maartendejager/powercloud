# Book Feature Adyen ID Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The book feature was using the wrong balance account ID in Adyen URLs. It was using the internal database ID (like "1") instead of the actual Adyen balance account ID (like "BA_...").

## Root Cause
The response handling code had incorrect fallback logic:
```javascript
// WRONG - was falling back to internal ID
this.adyenBalanceAccountId = response.adyenBalanceAccountId || 
                           response.balanceAccountId || 
                           null;
```

## Solution Implemented
1. **Removed Incorrect Fallback**: Updated response handling to only use the actual Adyen balance account ID:
   ```javascript
   // CORRECT - only uses Adyen ID
   this.adyenBalanceAccountId = response.adyenBalanceAccountId || null;
   ```

2. **Added Validation**: Added checks to prevent button creation when no Adyen balance account ID is available:
   ```javascript
   if (!this.adyenBalanceAccountId) {
     console.warn('[PowerCloud] Cannot create Adyen button: No Adyen balance account ID available');
     return;
   }
   ```

3. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track both internal and Adyen IDs separately.

## Files Modified
- `/content_scripts/features/adyen-book.js` - Fixed response handling logic in two locations
- `/testing/book-adyen-id-fix-test.js` - Created comprehensive test suite

## Validation Results
✅ All 4 test cases pass:
- Correct response with Adyen ID → Button created with proper BA_... URL
- Missing Adyen ID → Button correctly not created  
- Old response structure → Button correctly not created
- Mixed IDs → Button created with Adyen ID, not internal ID

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- **With Adyen Balance Account ID**: Button appears and opens correct Adyen URL with "BA_..." format
- **Without Adyen Balance Account ID**: Button does not appear (prevents incorrect URLs)
- **Debug Logging**: Clear distinction between internal ID and Adyen ID in console logs

## Testing Instructions
1. Go to a book page in PowerCloud
2. Open browser console  
3. Look for log messages about balance account IDs
4. If button appears, click it and verify URL contains "BA_..." not just a number
5. If button doesn't appear, check console for "No Adyen balance account ID" message

This fix ensures the book feature only creates functional Adyen links when proper Adyen balance account IDs are available.
