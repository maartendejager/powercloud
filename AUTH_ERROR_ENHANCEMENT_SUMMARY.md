# Authentication Error Handling Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the PowerCloud Chrome extension's authentication token error handling to provide more user-friendly guidance when tokens are expired, instead of throwing generic errors.

## Problem Statement
Previously, when no valid authentication token was found, the extension would throw generic error messages like "No valid authentication tokens found". This was not helpful to users, especially when they were on a page where tokens had expired but could be refreshed by reloading the page.

## Solution Implemented

### Key Changes
1. **Enhanced `getToken()` functions** in both `shared/auth.js` and `shared/auth-module.js`
2. **Improved error messages** in `shared/api.js` and `shared/api-module.js`
3. **Context-aware error handling** that considers environment and development status

### New Logic Flow
```
1. Check for valid tokens matching environment/dev criteria
2. If valid tokens found → Return token
3. If no valid tokens found:
   a. Check for EXPIRED tokens matching the same criteria
   b. If expired tokens exist → Show user-friendly "refresh page" message
   c. If no tokens at all → Show generic error message
```

### Error Message Examples

#### Before (Generic):
```
"No valid authentication tokens found"
"No valid authentication token found for environment 'customer' and isDev=false"
```

#### After (Context-Aware):
```
"Authentication token expired for environment 'customer' (production). Please refresh the page to capture a new token."
"Authentication token expired for environment 'testenv' (development). Please refresh the page to capture a new token."
"Authentication token expired. Please refresh the page to capture a new token."
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/shared/auth.js`
- Enhanced `getToken()` function with expired token detection
- Added logic to check for matching expired tokens before throwing errors
- Implemented environment and development context in error messages

### 2. `/shared/auth-module.js`
- Applied same enhancements as `auth.js` for ES6 module compatibility
- Maintained consistent behavior between both module systems

### 3. `/shared/api.js`
- Updated `validateTokenBeforeRequest()` to pass through improved error messages
- Enhanced error handling to preserve context-specific messages from `getToken()`

### 4. `/shared/api-module.js`
- Applied same API improvements for ES6 module compatibility
- Consistent error handling across module systems

### 5. `/README.md`
- Added changelog entry for version 1.2.1
- Documented the enhancement with user-facing description

### 6. `/DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md`
- Added technical details about the implementation
- Documented the problem and solution for future developers

## Testing

### Created Test Files
1. **`test-auth-error-handling.html`** - Interactive browser test page
2. **`testing/auth-error-handling-validation.js`** - Automated validation test

### Test Scenarios Covered
1. **Production environment with expired token** - Shows environment-specific refresh message
2. **Development environment with expired token** - Shows dev-specific refresh message  
3. **Non-existent environment** - Shows old-style error (no matching tokens)
4. **No tokens at all** - Shows generic "no tokens found" error

## Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Existing error handling behavior preserved for edge cases
- ✅ No breaking changes to function signatures or return types
- ✅ Enhanced messages only appear when expired tokens exist for the environment
- ✅ Generic errors still shown when no tokens exist at all

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Clear guidance** on how to resolve authentication issues
- **Environment context** helps understand which customer/environment has the issue
- **Actionable instructions** ("refresh the page") instead of generic errors

### For Developers
- **Better debugging** with environment-specific error messages
- **Reduced support requests** due to clearer user guidance
- **Consistent error handling** across all authentication flows

## Implementation Quality
- **No syntax errors** - All files pass validation
- **Consistent logic** - Same implementation across both module systems
- **Comprehensive testing** - Both interactive and automated tests created
- **Documentation** - Updated README and development notes
- **Changelog** - Proper version tracking with clear description

## Usage
The enhancement automatically takes effect when users encounter authentication errors. No configuration or manual intervention required.

When a user sees an error like:
> "Authentication token expired for environment 'mycustomer' (production). Please refresh the page to capture a new token."

They know exactly:
1. What the problem is (expired token)
2. Which environment it affects (mycustomer/production)
3. How to fix it (refresh the page)

This replaces the previous generic error that gave no actionable guidance.
