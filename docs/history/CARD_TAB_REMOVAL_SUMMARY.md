# Card Info Tab Removal Summary

## Overview
Removed the "Card Info" tab and its associated functionality from the PowerCloud extension popup since the same functionality is now available in the Page Actions tab, making it redundant.

## Changes Made

### HTML Changes (`popup/popup.html`)
- Removed "Card Info" tab from the tabs section
- Removed entire `card-section` div with all its contents:
  - Customer domain input field
  - Card ID input field  
  - "View Card at Adyen" button
  - Result display area

### JavaScript Changes (`popup/popup.js`)
- Removed `fillCardDetailsFromActiveTab()` function
- Removed `showCardResult()` function
- Removed card tab event listener
- Updated `switchToTab()` function to remove card-section references
- Removed card details form functionality and event handlers
- Removed card tab visibility logic based on current page

### CSS Changes (`popup/popup.css`)
- Removed card-specific styles:
  - `.form-group` styles 
  - `.input-field` styles
  - `.result-box` styles (no longer used)
  - `#card-result-content` styles
- Kept `.action-button` styles since they're still used in other parts of the popup

## Result
The popup now has 3 tabs instead of 4:
1. **Page Actions** (default) - Contains card viewing functionality automatically based on current page
2. **Auth Tokens** - Authentication token management
3. **Health Dashboard** - Extension health monitoring

The card viewing functionality remains available through the Page Actions tab, which automatically detects when the user is on a card page and provides the same "View Card in Adyen" functionality.

## Benefits
- Reduced UI complexity
- Eliminated redundant functionality
- Cleaner, more focused popup interface
- Same functionality available but more contextually appropriate in Page Actions
