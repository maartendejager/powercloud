# Token Display Enhancement

## Overview
This document outlines the enhancements made to improve the display of token information in the PowerCloud extension, specifically addressing the issue where tenant names were not correctly displayed in the UI.

## Problem Statement
The token display was sometimes showing incorrect tenant names. For example, a token from "proactive.spend.cloud" was displaying "production" as the tenant name instead of "proactive".

## Root Cause
After investigation, we identified the following issues:

1. **Limited Tenant Name Extraction**: The extension was relying solely on the `clientEnvironment` field stored with the token, which was extracted from the URL pattern. However, this doesn't account for JWT payloads that might contain more accurate tenant information.

2. **Confusion Between Environment Type and Tenant Name**: The UI was not clearly separating the tenant name (e.g., "proactive") from the environment type (production/development).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Token Tenant Name Extraction
- Added capability to extract tenant name from the JWT payload's `client` field
- Prioritized JWT payload information over URL extraction
- Implemented fallback mechanism to ensure a tenant name is always available

### 2. Improved UI for Token Cards
- Redesigned token cards to clearly separate tenant name from environment type
- Enhanced styling to make the tenant name more prominent
- Added explicit labeling for both tenant name and environment type
- Included additional metadata display at the bottom of each token card

### 3. Debugging Tools
- Created a validator utility to check if tenant names are being correctly extracted
- Added functions to validate individual tokens or all tokens at once
- Implemented detailed logging to help identify any mismatches

## How to Use the Validator

If you need to verify that tenant names are correctly displayed:

1. Open the browser console in the extension popup
2. Run `validateAllTokens()` to check all stored tokens
3. Review the output to identify any mismatches between stored and expected tenant names

## Files Modified

- `/popup/popup.js`: Added tenant extraction utility and updated token card creation
- `/shared/auth.js`: Enhanced token processing to extract tenant from JWT payload
- `/popup/token-styles.css`: Updated styling to better distinguish tenant from environment type
- `/testing/token-tenant-extraction-validator.js`: Added validation utilities

## Future Improvements

1. Consider renaming `clientEnvironment` to `tenantName` in the internal data structure for clarity
2. Implement a data migration process to update existing stored tokens with correct tenant names
3. Add more robust extraction for tenant names from various JWT payload formats
