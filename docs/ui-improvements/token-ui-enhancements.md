# Auth Tokens UI Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the UI enhancements made to the Auth Tokens section of the PowerCloud Chrome extension. The improvements address several usability and design issues to create a more user-friendly interface.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Metrics Grid
**Issue:** The metrics grid was not visually appealing and took up too much space.
**Solution:** Redesigned the metrics grid to be more compact while still visually interesting:
- Added colored borders based on metric type (purple for total, green for valid, etc.)
- Enhanced with subtle gradient animations
- Improved typography with better spacing

### 2. Token Value Display
**Issue:** Long token values without spaces overflowed and caused layout issues.
**Solution:** Improved token value display:
- Added `word-break: break-all` and `overflow-wrap: break-word` CSS properties
- Set `white-space: normal` to allow wrapping
- Added scrolling with `max-height` and `overflow-y: auto`
- Added subtle border and background for better readability
- Added inset box shadow for depth effect

### 3. Tenant Name Visibility
**Issue:** The tenant name (formerly called client environment) wasn't prominently displayed, while the environment type (dev/prod) wasn't clearly distinguishable.
**Solution:** Enhanced the tenant and environment type display:
- Made the tenant name large and prominent at the top of each token card
- Created a separate badge for development/production environment type
- Used proper semantic coloring (orange for development, green for production)
- Improved typography and visual hierarchy of information

### 4. Button Height Consistency
**Issue:** "Copy" and "Delete" buttons had inconsistent heights.
**Solution:** Standardized button styling:
- Set fixed height (36px) for all buttons
- Used flexbox alignment for consistent centering
- Added consistent padding, minimum width, and text styling
- Improved hover and active states
- Made buttons same size with equal flex distribution

## Implementation
The improvements were implemented through a combination of:
1. Dedicated CSS file (`token-styles.css`) for better organization
2. Updated HTML structure in the token card creation function
3. Enhanced UI components with modern CSS features

## Design Principles
The redesign follows these design principles:
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Important information (client environment, dev/prod status) is more prominent
- **Information Architecture:** Clear separation between client environment and dev/prod status
- **Consistency:** UI elements with similar functions have consistent styling
- **Space Efficiency:** Content is displayed compactly without sacrificing readability
- **Readability:** Long text content is properly handled with appropriate wrapping and overflow

## Future Improvements
Potential future enhancements could include:
- Collapsible token details to save space when many tokens are present
- Copy-to-clipboard indicators or tooltips
- Better token categorization or filtering options
- Light/dark theme support
