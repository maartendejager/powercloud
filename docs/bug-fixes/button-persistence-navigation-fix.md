# Button Persistence During Navigation Fix

## Problem Description
When navigating from a page with PowerCloud features (that shows buttons) to a page where those features aren't appropriate, the buttons remained visible instead of being removed or hidden. This created a confusing user experience where buttons appeared on pages where they shouldn't be active.

## Root Cause
1. The `PowerCloudButtonManager` is implemented as a singleton that persists across page navigations
2. While individual features have cleanup methods when navigating away from pages, the button container itself remained in the DOM
3. There was no global cleanup mechanism when navigating to pages where no features should be active
4. Single-page application (SPA) navigation techniques used by some pages don't trigger the traditional page unload events

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global Button Container Cleanup
Added a global cleanup function to ensure button containers are completely removed when not on a supported page:
```javascript
function cleanupButtonContainer() {
  if (window.PowerCloudButtonManager?.instance) {
    window.PowerCloudButtonManager.instance.cleanup();
  } else if (document.getElementById('powercloud-button-container')) {
    // Direct DOM removal as fallback if manager isn't available
    const container = document.getElementById('powercloud-button-container');
    container.remove();
  }
}
```

### 2. Feature Pattern URL Check
Added a function to check if the current URL matches any of the supported feature URL patterns:
```javascript
function runFeatureCheck() {
  // Check if any feature URL pattern matches the current URL
  const currentUrl = window.location.href;
  
  // Check if any feature in our feature array matches the URL
  const matchesAnyFeature = features.some(feature => {
    return feature.urlPattern.test(currentUrl);
  });
  
  if (!matchesAnyFeature) {
    // Clean up any UI elements if we're not on a supported page
    cleanupButtonContainer();
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Feature Manager
Modified the feature manager to include our cleanup logic after regular initialization:
```javascript
function enhanceFeatureManager() {
  if (window.featureManager) {
    // Store the original init method
    const originalInit = window.featureManager.init;
    
    // Override the init method to also run our feature check
    window.featureManager.init = function() {
      const result = originalInit.apply(this, arguments);
      
      // After regular initialization, run our check to clean up if needed
      runFeatureCheck();
      
      return result;
    };
  }
}
```

### 4. SPA Navigation Detection
Added a mutation observer and history API modifications to detect navigation in single-page applications:
```javascript
function setupSpaNavigationObserver() {
  // Store the current URL to detect changes
  let lastUrl = window.location.href;
  
  // Create a mutation observer to watch for DOM changes that might indicate navigation
  const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
    // If URL changed, we have navigation
    if (lastUrl !== window.location.href) {
      // Update stored URL
      lastUrl = window.location.href;
      
      // Run our feature check to clean up UI if needed
      runFeatureCheck();
    }
  });
  
  // Start observing the whole document
  observer.observe(document, { 
    childList: true,
    subtree: true
  });
  
  // Also listen for the history API
  const originalPushState = window.history.pushState;
  const originalReplaceState = window.history.replaceState;
  
  window.history.pushState = function() {
    originalPushState.apply(this, arguments);
    setTimeout(runFeatureCheck, 50);
  };
  
  window.history.replaceState = function() {
    originalReplaceState.apply(this, arguments);
    setTimeout(runFeatureCheck, 50);
  };
}
```

## Benefits
1. Buttons are now properly removed when navigating to unsupported pages
2. Works with both traditional page navigation and modern SPA navigation
3. Ensures a clean user experience with UI elements only appearing where appropriate
4. Handles error cases for more reliable operation
5. Provides logging for easier debugging

## Testing
Test by navigating from a page with PowerCloud features (like a card page) to a page without supported features. The buttons should disappear when you navigate away from the supported page.
