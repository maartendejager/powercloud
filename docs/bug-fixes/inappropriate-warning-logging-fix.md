# Fix: Inappropriate Warning Logging for Expected Missing Functionality

## Issue Description
The system was logging WARNING level messages when pages legitimately didn't have required functionality. Specifically, when visiting a book page that doesn't have an Adyen balance account, the system logged warning messages even though this is normal behavior since not all books are expected to have Adyen integration.

## Root Cause
In `content_scripts/features/adyen-book.js`, two locations were using `bookLogger.warn()` to log the absence of Adyen balance account IDs:

1. **Line 216**: During button creation - when no `remoteBalanceAccountId` was available
2. **Line 571**: During book info click handling - when no `remoteBalanceAccountId` was available

These scenarios represent expected behavior for books without Adyen integration, not error conditions that warrant warning-level logging.

## Solution
Changed the logging level from `WARN` to `INFO` for both locations and improved the messages to clarify that this is normal behavior:

### Location 1: Button Creation (around line 216)
**Before:**
```javascript
bookLogger.warn('Cannot create Adyen button: No Adyen balance account ID available');
```

**After:**
```javascript
bookLogger.info('Cannot create Adyen button: No Adyen balance account ID available (this is normal for books without Adyen integration)');
```

### Location 2: Book Info Click Handler (around line 571)
**Before:**
```javascript
bookLogger.warn('No Adyen balance account ID available for book');
this.showBookInfoResult('No Adyen Balance Account ID found for this book', 'warning');
```

**After:**
```javascript
bookLogger.info('No Adyen balance account ID available for book (this is normal for books without Adyen integration)');
this.showBookInfoResult('No Adyen Balance Account ID found for this book', 'info');
```

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Users will no longer see warning messages in logs when visiting books without Adyen integration
- **Debugging**: Logs will better reflect actual issues vs. expected behavior
- **Monitoring**: Warning-level logs will be more meaningful and actionable

## Files Modified
- `/content_scripts/features/adyen-book.js` - Changed two instances of inappropriate warning logging to info level

## Testing
To test this fix:
1. Visit a book page that doesn't have Adyen integration
2. Check browser console/logs - should see INFO level messages instead of WARNING
3. Verify that legitimate warnings (actual errors) are still logged appropriately
