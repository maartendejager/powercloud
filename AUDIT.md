# Feature Script Audit Results

## Overview

This document provides the results of an audit performed on May 21, 2025 to ensure that all feature scripts in the PowerCloud extension support a consistent loading method and do not attempt to load via multiple methods simultaneously.

## Loading Method Selected

**Manifest-only Loading**

All feature scripts are now loaded via the `content_scripts` section in `manifest.json` and do not use dynamic loading. This approach was chosen because:

1. It provides more predictable loading order
2. It simplifies the codebase by removing dynamic loading code
3. It reduces the risk of race conditions and duplicate loading

## Feature Scripts Audited

| Script | Loading Method | Namespace Registration | Status |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|--------|
| adyen-card.js | Manifest-only | `window.PowerCloudFeatures.card` | ✅ |
| adyen-book.js | Manifest-only | `window.PowerCloudFeatures.book` | ✅ |
| token-detector.js | Manifest-only | `window.PowerCloudFeatures.tokenDetector` | ✅ |

## Changes Made

1. Updated each feature script to:
   - Include clear documentation about its loading method
   - Properly initialize its namespace in `window.PowerCloudFeatures`
   - Register its public functions in that namespace

2. Updated `main.js` to:
   - Remove any dynamic script loading
   - Rely only on scripts loaded via manifest
   - Include clear documentation about the loading approach

3. Verified that `manifest.json` correctly lists all required feature scripts in the `content_scripts` section

## Future Considerations

1. If new feature scripts are added, they should follow the manifest-only loading pattern.
2. The `web_accessible_resources` section in `manifest.json` should not include feature scripts, as they are not dynamically loaded.
3. Consider adding script loading detection in the future to prevent duplicate initialization if a script somehow gets loaded twice.
