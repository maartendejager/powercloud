## Current Status

### ✅ Phase 5.1 - Adyen Features Enhancement: COMPLETE
All three Adyen features now:
- Use BaseFeature architecture for consistency
- Handle response structure variations correctly
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use correct Adyen URLs with proper formatting
- Have comprehensive logging and debugging

### ✅ Legacy Cleanup: COMPLETE
- Removed 20 legacy files (7 features + 9 tests + 4 docs)
- Preserved essential working code and documentation
- Maintained clean, organized project structure
- Updated improvement plan to reflect completion

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with **Phase 5.2 - UI/UX Improvements** or any other planned enhancements from the improvement plan.

## Benefits Achieved
- **Cleaner codebase**: Removed 20 redundant/obsolete files
- **Reduced confusion**: No more old/new/backup file variants
- **Better maintainability**: Clear, single source of truth for each feature
- **Preserved knowledge**: Kept essential documentation and test infrastructure
- **Ready for next phase**: Clean foundation for future improvements
