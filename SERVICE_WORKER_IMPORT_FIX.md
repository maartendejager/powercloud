# üîß Service Worker Dynamic Import Fix

## ‚ùå **Issue Identified**
```
Card API request failed: import() is disallowed on ServiceWorkerGlobalScope by the HTML specification. 
See https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1356.
```

**Location**: `shared/api-module.js:24`
**Problem**: Used dynamic `import()` inside service worker context, which is prohibited by HTML spec

## ‚úÖ **Fix Applied**

### **What Was Changed:**

1. **Replaced dynamic import with static import**
   ```javascript
   // BEFORE (line 24):
   const { getToken } = await import('./auth-module.js');
   
   // AFTER (top of file):
   import { getToken, extractClientEnvironment, isDevelopmentRoute } from './auth-module.js';
   ```

2. **Removed duplicate helper functions**
   - Removed local `extractClientEnvironment()` function  
   - Removed local `isDevelopmentRoute()` function
   - Now using imported versions from `auth-module.js`

3. **Cleaned up code structure**
   - All imports now at top of file (ES6 standard)
   - No more async imports in service worker context
   - Consistent with other module files

### **Why This Fixes The Issue:**

- **Service Workers cannot use dynamic imports** due to security and timing constraints
- **Static imports are resolved at module load time**, before service worker starts
- **Follows ES6 module standards** with all imports at the top of the file

## üöÄ **Ready for Testing**

The extension should now load without the service worker import error. 

**Expected Behavior:**
- No more "import() is disallowed" errors
- Service worker loads successfully  
- All API functions work correctly
- Card details requests succeed

**Next Step:** Reload extension in Chrome to test the fix!

## üìÅ **File Modified:**
- `shared/api-module.js` - Fixed dynamic import issue ‚úÖ
