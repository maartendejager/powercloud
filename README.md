# PowerCloud Developer Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that provides extra functionality for developers working with the spend.cloud platform. This extension captures and displays authentication tokens to assist with troubleshooting and development tasks.

The extension works on both production (`https://[customer].spend.cloud/*`) and development environments (`https://[customer].dev.spend.cloud/*`).

### For Testing
See the [Testing Documentation](./docs/testing/) for comprehensive testing procedures and guides.

## Token Terminology

To maintain clarity in the codebase and UI, we use the following terminology:

- **Tenant Name**: The client organization name, stored as `clientEnvironment` in the code (e.g., "customer1", "acme-corp")
- **Environment Type**: Whether the environment is development or production, stored as `isDevRoute` (true/false)

For detailed clarification, see [Token Terminology Clarification](./docs/ui-improvements/token-terminology-clarification.md).

## Installation

This extension can be installed in two ways: manually for development and testing, or from the Chrome Web Store for regular use.

### Manual Installation (for Development and Testing)

Follow these steps to install the extension on your local machine. This is useful for testing new features or for colleagues who want to use the extension before it's on the Chrome Web Store.

**1. Get the Extension Files**

You have two options:

*   **Download as ZIP (easiest method):**
    1.  On the GitHub page of this project, click the green `<> Code` button.
    2.  Select `Download ZIP` from the dropdown menu.
    3.  Save the ZIP file to your computer.
    4.  Unzip the file. Remember where you saved the unzipped folder, you'll need it in a moment. The unzipped folder might have a name like `PowerCloud-main`.

*   **Clone the Repository (for developers):**
    1.  If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository using the command:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
        ```

**2. Install in Chrome**

1.  Open your Google Chrome browser.
2.  Navigate to the extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar and pressing Enter.
3.  In the top-right corner of the page, turn on **"Developer mode"** using the toggle switch.
4.  Three new buttons will appear: `Load unpacked`, `Pack extension`, and `Update`. Click on **`Load unpacked`**.
5.  A file selection dialog will open. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped or cloned the extension files (e.g., `PowerCloud-main`).
6.  Select the entire folder and click "Select Folder".
7.  The PowerCloud extension should now appear in your list of extensions and in your browser toolbar (you might need to click the puzzle piece icon to see it).

### From Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

1.  Navigate to the Chrome Web Store (link to be added)
2.  Click "Add to Chrome"
3.  Confirm the installation

## Usage

### Token Management
1. Click the PowerCloud icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup
2. Navigate to any spend.cloud page while logged in
3. The extension will automatically capture authentication tokens sent in requests
4. View captured tokens in the popup window
5. Click the "Copy" button to copy a token to your clipboard
6. The extension automatically uses the correct token for each client environment (tenant) and for development/production contexts

### Card Payment Instrument ID
There are two ways to get a card's Adyen Payment Instrument ID:

#### From Card Settings Page
1. Navigate to a card settings page with ID 265 (https://[customer].spend.cloud/cards/265/*)
2. A green button will appear in the bottom-right corner
3. Click the "View Card at Adyen" button to open the card details directly in Adyen's dashboard

2. Click on the "Card Info" tab
3. Enter the customer domain and card ID
4. Click "View Card at Adyen" button
5. The card details will open directly in Adyen's dashboard in a new tab

### View Card Book
For cards that have an associated book, the extension provides a feature to view the card book:

1. Navigate to a card page (https://[customer].spend.cloud/cards/[card-id]/* or other supported card pages)
2. A green "View Card Book" button will appear in the bottom-right corner next to the "View in Adyen" button
3. The extension will automatically check if the card has a relationship to a book
4. If a book ID is found, the button will be enabled
5. Click the button to view the card's associated book for the current month/year directly in a new tab

### Monetary Account Books
For monetary account books, the extension provides a feature to view the balance account at Adyen:

1. Navigate to a book page (https://[customer].spend.cloud/proactive/kasboek.boekingen/[book-id]/*)
2. If the book is a monetary account book, a button will appear in the bottom-right corner
3. The extension will automatically check if the book has a direct relationship to an Adyen balance account
4. If a balance account ID is found, the button will be enabled, showing either the balance account reference or ID
5. Click the button to view the account directly in Adyen's dashboard

## Security Note

This extension is intended for development and troubleshooting purposes only. JWT tokens provide access to authenticated resources, so handle them with care and never share them with unauthorized individuals.

## Testing

### Testing with Development Domains

You can test the extension with both standard and development domains:

1. **Standard domain**: `https://[customer].spend.cloud/*`
2. **Development domain**: `https://[customer].dev.spend.cloud/*`

To verify functionality on development domains:

1. Install the extension in developer mode
2. Navigate to a supported development domain (e.g., `https://example.dev.spend.cloud/cards/123`)
3. Confirm that the extension features appear and work correctly
4. Test token capture by making API requests on the development domain

## Development

### Feature Development with BaseFeature

Starting with version 1.2.0, new features can be built using the BaseFeature foundation for standardized structure and enhanced reliability:

```javascript
class MyNewFeature extends BaseFeature {
  constructor() {
    super('myNewFeature', {
      enableDebugLogging: true // Enable for development
    });
  }

  onInit(match) {
    super.onInit(match);
    // Your initialization code here
  }

  onCleanup() {
    // Your cleanup code here
    super.onCleanup();
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Standardized lifecycle management
- Built-in error handling with context
- Debug logging for troubleshooting  
- State tracking (isInitialized, isActive)
- Backward compatibility with existing features

See `shared/base-feature-docs.md` for complete documentation and migration examples.
