## Implementation Guidelines

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Core architecture and critical bug fixes
- **Medium**: Developer experience and code quality improvements  
- **Low**: Advanced features and nice-to-have enhancements

### Implementation Order
1. Start with Phase 1 (Core Architecture) - most critical
2. Complete Phase 2 (Background Service Worker) 
3. Move to Phase 3 (Developer Experience)
4. Continue with Phase 4 (Code Quality)
5. Implement Phase 5 (Feature-Specific)
6. Finally Phase 6 (Advanced Features)

### Validation Criteria
Each item should be considered complete when:
- [ ] Implementation is finished and tested
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Code review is completed
- [ ] No new bugs or regressions introduced
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable
