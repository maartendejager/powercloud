## Implementation Guidelines

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Core architecture and critical bug fixes
- **Medium**: Developer experience and code quality improvements  
- **Low**: Advanced features and nice-to-have enhancements

### Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1** (Core Architecture Foundation) - Essential for maintainability
2. **Phase 2** (Testing Infrastructure) - Moved up to support refactoring
3. **Phase 3** (Developer Experience) - Important for long-term productivity
4. **Phase 4** (Code Quality) - Complete testing and documentation
5. **Phase 5** (Feature-Specific) - Apply patterns to existing features
6. **Phase 6** (Advanced Features) - Only if clearly beneficial

### Milestone Strategy
- **Start Small**: Implement one item from Phase 1 first, test, and commit
- **Incremental Progress**: Complete 2-3 related items before moving to next phase
- **Regular Reviews**: After each milestone, evaluate if the plan needs adjustment
- **Test Early**: Include basic testing from Phase 2 alongside Phase 1 work

### Validation Criteria
Each item should be considered complete when:
- [ ] Implementation is finished and tested
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Code review is completed
- [ ] No new bugs or regressions introduced
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable
- [ ] Extension functionality remains reliable
