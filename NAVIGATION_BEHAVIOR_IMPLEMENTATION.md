# Navigation Behavior Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented differentiated navigation behavior for PowerCloud extension buttons based on their destination type.

## Changes Made

### 1. Spend Cloud Features (Internal Navigation - Same Tab)
**Modified Files:**
- `/content_scripts/features/view-entry-card.js`
- `/content_scripts/features/view-card-book.js`

**Navigation Method Changed:**
- **From:** `chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "openTab", url: ... })` (new tab)
- **To:** `window.location.href = url` (same tab)

**Features Affected:**
- **View Card Details** button (blue) - navigates from entry pages to card pages
- **View Card Book** button (blue) - navigates from card pages to book pages

### 2. Adyen Features (External Navigation - New Tab)
**Files Unchanged (retaining current behavior):**
- `/content_scripts/features/adyen-card.js`
- `/content_scripts/features/adyen-book.js`
- `/content_scripts/features/adyen-entries.js`

**Navigation Method Maintained:**
- `chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "openTab", url: ... })` (new tab)

**Features Affected:**
- **View Card in Adyen** button (green)
- **View Balance Account in Adyen** button (green)
- **View Entries in Adyen** button (green)

## Button Variants (Previously Implemented)
✅ **Adyen buttons:** Green (#0abf53) with `variant: 'adyen'`
✅ **Spend Cloud buttons:** Blue (#007aca) with `variant: 'spendcloud'`

## User Experience
- **Internal Navigation (Spend Cloud):** Users stay within their workflow when navigating between related Spend Cloud pages
- **External Navigation (Adyen):** Users can view Adyen data while keeping their Spend Cloud session active in the original tab

## Testing
Created `test-navigation-behavior.html` for documentation and testing guidance.

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation in a browser with the extension loaded
2. Verify that:
   - Spend Cloud buttons (blue) navigate in the same tab
   - Adyen buttons (green) open in a new tab
   - All button colors display correctly
   - Navigation works correctly for all features

## Files Modified
1. `view-entry-card.js` - Changed navigation to same tab
2. `view-card-book.js` - Changed navigation to same tab
3. `test-navigation-behavior.html` - Created for testing documentation

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)
- `adyen-card.js` - Correctly uses new tab navigation
- `adyen-book.js` - Correctly uses new tab navigation  
- `adyen-entries.js` - Correctly uses new tab navigation
- `shared/ui-components.js` - Button variants correctly implemented
