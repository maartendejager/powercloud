# UI Testing Files

This directory contains user interface testing files for the PowerCloud extension.

## Contents

- **debug-view-entry-card.js** - Debug utilities and tests for view entry card functionality

## Purpose

UI tests focus on:
- Visual component rendering
- User interaction flows
- UI state management
- Responsive design validation
- Accessibility compliance

## Usage

These files are designed to test UI components in isolation and within their full context. Load them in the browser to validate:
- Component appearance and layout
- Interactive behaviors
- Error states and edge cases
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Guidelines

- Test UI components in different states (loading, error, success)
- Validate responsive behavior across screen sizes
- Include accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Document any visual regression testing procedures
